# Saman-PR-Q2
Please put the “MT_Clearned.csv” and “VT_Cleaned.csv” in the same folder with “Q2.py” file.  The answers are shown in the below order:
•	The proportion of traffic stops in MT involving male drivers
•	Chi-Squared traffic stop arrest test statistic (The rows are “Male” and “Female”, and the columns are number of arrested case and number of out of state plates.)
•	The proportion of traffic stops in MT involving speeding violations
•	As we don’t have any information about 2020, the average manufacture year of stopped cased has been plotted and shown by the year (from 2009-2016) (Some interesting infomration can be seen)
•	As I didn’t understand the dependent values and the independent values of the regression, I consider the predication of number of the stopped case by the year. (the value of the 2009 was not good for linear predication, so in the next step I considered the years from 2010). You can see the p-value in the second table below the first figure as P>|t|.
•	In the following you can see the below results:
o	The difference in the total number between min and max hours (MT)
o	The difference in the total number between min and max hours (VT)
•	In addition, I did not understand the Q2 and Q4 and I sent an email 3 days ago. In addition, the dataset doesn’t have any information about the area of the counties. Would you please guide me about these questions?
